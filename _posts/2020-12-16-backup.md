### Code Samples

`Python`: Test that the `Backup` class raises an error when passed a file path
instead of a folder

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    'given_path',
    [
        'this path does not exist',
        Path('this path also does not exist')
    ]
)
def test_backup_init_not_dir(monkeypatch, given_path):
    '''Check error raising for non-directories'''
    # Pretend path exists
    monkeypatch.setattr(Path, 'exists', lambda _: True)
    with pytest.raises(NotADirectoryError):
        Backup(given_path)
```
